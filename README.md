It sounds like you've developed an impressive 36-hour hackathon project: a comprehensive college student application featuring:

Complaint Management
Faculty Availability Tracking
Election Management
Exam Misconduct Handling
College Doctor Appointment Scheduling
Real-time Notifications and Announcements
Leave Application Processing
Facility Booking System
Implementing distinct login portals for administrators, students, and faculty enhances user experience and security. Utilizing the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js—is a strategic choice for building scalable and maintainable applications. This approach aligns with industry practices, as seen in similar projects like the College Management System and the MERN College Management System.
